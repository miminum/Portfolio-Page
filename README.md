# My Portfolio Page
## www.danielhuong.netlify.com
## Aim
The main target of my portfolio website is future employers or clients. My goal is to create a clean and functional portfolio website which shows who I am and what my skills are. I want the aesthetic of the page to be simple but professional with a bit of flair.


## The Minimum Viable Product
Create a simple funtional portfolio website that includes a about me, portfolio, skills and contact me section.

It must be responsive so that it works on both mobile and desktops. 

Must have a favicon, nav bar, appropraite meta tags, contact form, social media icons and a smart blurb about myself.

## Inspiration
I prefer using more neutral colours especially black, white and greys as well as some mellow colours to balance out as seen in my initial mood board and design.

I also quite liked certain concepts seen on numerous portfolio pages such as:


[Chris Hardy Portfolio Page](http://chrishardydesigns.com/): I liked the simplicity of colours; white and light grey backgrounds and I especially liked the concept of the portfolio layout which had nice uneven geometry.

[Ben Adam Portfolio Page](http://benadam.me/): Similar concept here and I like the logo.


[Image Paralax Effect](https://codepen.io/abhi_sarkar96/pen/pryjvq): Paralax scenery shots that I took from my travels. 

## Some wilder inspiration
  * Scroll animation when clicking on navbar links like this [Codepen Example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/YqLyXB).
  * Scroll to top button which appears when you are below the initial full page.
  * Put a video on the initial page of the website. 

## Site Structure

#### Main Page
Either block background or image.
Hamburger navigation bar that turns into a horizontal clear bar on larger devices (Tablet and up)
#### About (title: “me”, “about me”, “my story”)
A few sentences about myself.

_Hi, My name is Daniel Huong. I'm an aspiring web developer based in Melbourne. I'm currently completing a an intensive web developement bootcamp at Coder Academy and can't wait to break into the world of tech._

_Previously, I worked in the business industry as an administrator, banker, consultant and am now enjoying the start of a career change into the world of web developement._

_If I'm not coding, you will find me snowboarding, hiking, camping, fifa, cooking or doing something interesting outdoors._
#### Skills (Can be merged in with About section):
List languages list either wording or through black and white icons. 
HTML5, CSS3 & a bit of CSS4, SASS/SCSS, Stylus, React, Mongodb, SQL, JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Express.js.

#### Projects
Image grid of projects

  * Gro Pro hero:
Ruby Terminal App. Group assignment from Coderacademy bootcamp.
  *  Local Weather app: Freecodecamp project, first use of APIs accessing. 
Problems involve using google's services which no longer worked due to chromes upgrades.
  * Random Quote Machine:
Freecodecamp project. First project using Javascript. Using array of quotes and authors and using Math.random to generate quotes on each click of the button.
  * Hybrid Animals:
First HTML/CSS challenge from Bootcamp. Enjoyed creating the Navbar and the underline from the active page. Insert netlify link. 
#### Contacts
Create HTML/CSS form that includes, firstname, lastname, email, message and submit button.

## What I learnt
  * Meta Tags
  * How to do an image parralax
  * How to use pure HTML/CSS to make a hamburger menu for smaller devices
  * Some animations such as the logo animation
  * Typography pairing
  * Making a .svg logo through figma and turning that into a favicon.


## Some Problems
  * I could not get the image parralax to work on mobile devices; I just had to fix the image to a certain position so that the focal point could be viewed.
  * Colour pallete may not be geared towards the target audience. The contact section of my webpage initially had a black background but I changed it to grey to be more neutral.
  * Logo doesn't look that clean and it interferes with the underline of the a: hover elements on the nav bar
  * Title page could be more interesting.
  * Have a lot of duplicate CSS properties that could have been joined together to have less code. I have about 400 lines of css.

### Conclusion:
I quite enjoyed this project. It was a good experience and
